## Recap of the 2020 team's work
- procured two cameras and two lenses
    - 2.3MP a2A1920-160ucBAS (Sony IMX392) colour cameras from Basler
    - Horizontal resolution of 1920 pixels at 160 FPS 
- tested the stereo vision pipeline using pre-rendered track footage via Blender

## 2021 stereo vision goals
- Detect real world blue and yellow traffic cones at 15m
- Achieve an estimated displacement error of less than 0.5m 

## Next step forward
- Familiarise myself with the current stereo vision pipeline
- Gather training data to test the robustness of the current pipeline
- Test the pipeline with ROS/Gazebo
- Test the camera calibration and the effects of motion (moving cameras were not tested previously)
    - Design experiments and methods of dealign with this problem

Once we receive word that we can install the sensors on the race car:
- print mounting tabs for the stereo cameras 
- test the thermal requirements (may require external fans?)

## Not covered this year
- Hardware optimization for the Jetson AGX Xavier
